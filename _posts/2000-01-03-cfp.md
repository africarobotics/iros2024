## Call for Participation

We invite researchers (including faculty, students, and industry engineers) from,
or collaborating with, African institutions to submit a 2-4 page extended abstract
following the IEEE conference format. These abstracts should highlight exciting
research outcomes, ongoing projects, and demonstrations that showcase the diverse
landscape of robotics research and industry initiatives in Africa. The forum
organizers will review the submissions, and accepted abstracts will be featured
in the poster and demo presentation session during the forum. The results from
the forum will be collated into a peer-reviewed publication.
